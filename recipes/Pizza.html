    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
      <li>3⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>¼ cup tomato sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes</li>
      <li>¼ cup sliced black olives</li>
      <li>¼ cup roasted red peppers</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm
        water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam,
        about 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away
        from the sides of the bowl. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Knead
        until smooth, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and
        cover with a damp cloth. Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
        Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more
        hour, or until doubled again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with
        minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat for 30 seconds in
        the microwave; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape
        3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush grill grate with garlic-flavored olive oil. Carefully place one
        piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost
        immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over
        using two spatulas. Working quickly, brush oil over crust, and then
        brush with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Arrange 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes,
        1/8 cup sliced black olives, and 1/8 cup roasted red peppers over crust.
        Sprinkle with 1 cup cheese and 2 tablespoons basil. Close the lid, and
        cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a
        few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.
